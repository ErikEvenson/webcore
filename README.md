# Base box

This is a base vagrant box.

## Setting up the base box

Using the base box requires installing two packages on the host machine: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).  Both are free.  On a Mac, the easiest way to install both is via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) and [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask).

Install the [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) plugin to enable the [VirtualBox Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html).

```
	vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

Remove any existing vagrant boxes.
	
```
	vagrant destroy
```

Refresh the base box if desired.  This shouldn't really be necessary.

```
	vagrant box remove <box name>
```

## Using the base box

Bring up the box -- this will take a while the first time to both download and provision the box.  A password may be necessary for the host to enable folder syncing.

```
	vagrant up
```

Enter the virtual development environment on the web server.

```
	vagrant ssh
```

When done, exit the virtual environment and `vagrant halt` to stop the virtual machine.  Use `vagrant destroy` to reclaim the disk space (although this will require you to re-provision the machine again later).  `vagrant remove` should be used to remove the base box from the system as well.  `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh web` to start another development session later.
