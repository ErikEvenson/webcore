This app was generated by eeegen.

## Developing

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.

To run the app on a development server:

```bash
  gulp
```

You should be able to see the app at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

To clean and then build the app into the `build` directory:

```bash
  gulp clean && gulp build
```

To run the built app on a development server:

```bash
  cd build && npm start
```

To deploy the built app to Heroku:

Enter secret credentials into `config/env.js` starting from the `config/env.sample.js` template.

To setup the app for the first time:

```bash
  gulp heroku-setup
```

This will create a tarball in the `temp` directory, upload it to a temporary location on AWS, and have Heroku use it to provision the app.  TBD -- allow choice of app name.  The app will be available at [https://appName.herokuapp.com](https://appName.herokuapp.com) after a short delay.

To deploy an already provisioned and re-built app with changes:

```bash
  gulp heroku-deploy --app appName
```

To ease deployment, add the app name as an instance to `config/build.js` and deploy with:

```bash
  gulp heroku-deploy --instance staging
```
